You are evaluating whether a faculty member’s research matches a grant.

Grant Domains: {grant_domains}
Grant Specializations: {grant_specs}

Faculty Domains: {fac_domains}
Faculty Specializations: {fac_specs}

Initial Semantic Similarity Score (domains only): {domain_score}

Task:
1. Evaluate whether the domains conceptually align.
2. Evaluate whether the faculty’s specializations meaningfully relate to the grant’s specializations.
3. Provide a refined relevance score between 0 and 1.
4. Be concise; 3–4 sentences.
