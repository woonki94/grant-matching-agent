You are an information extraction assistant.

Your task is to analyze the following faculty research profile and extract
structured research-related keywords into the following categories
(Extract up to {max_keywords} for each category):

1. **area** – Broad academic domain (e.g., Engineering, Computer Science, Biology)
2. **discipline** – Specialized subfield within the area (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Robotics)
3. **application_domain** – Real-world or industrial problem area where the faculty’s research is applied (e.g., Healthcare, Agriculture, Climate Adaptation)
4. **research_area** – Core scientific or technical research topics that describe the faculty’s expertise or publication themes (e.g., Machine Learning, Computer Vision)
5. **methods** – Analytical, experimental, or computational techniques frequently used by the faculty (e.g., Regression Analysis, Field Survey, Reinforcement Learning)
6. **models** – Specific algorithmic, mathematical, or conceptual models studied or developed by the faculty (e.g., Transformer, CNN, Random Forest, Bayesian Network)

Guidelines:
- Use short, meaningful phrases or single words.
- Focus on topics that describe the faculty’s **expertise, research methods, and technical focus areas**.
- You may need to refer to the faculty’s **research website, publications, or additional links** to understand their research interests more completely.
- Avoid administrative or generic terms like "teaching", "education", "publication", "grant", "university".
- If a category has no clear information, leave it empty or use an empty list.
- Use multi-word phrases **only when necessary** for clarity (e.g., "reinforcement learning").
- Be concise but informative.
- Output **only** valid JSON in the format shown below.

Expected JSON format:
{
  "area": "string",
  "discipline": "string",
  "application_domain": ["string", ...],
  "research_area": ["string", ...],
  "methods": ["string", ...],
  "models": ["string", ...]
}
