You are an information extraction assistant.

Extract structured multi-label research keywords from the following grant text.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact schema:

{
  "research": {
    "domain": ["string", ...],
    "specialization": ["string", ...]
  },
  "application": {
    "domain": ["string", ...],
    "specialization": ["string", ...]
  }
}

Guidelines:
- Each value is a LIST (even if single-valued).
- Use 1–3 concise terms for "domain" (1–2 words each).
- Use 3–10 SHORT PHRASES for "specialization", each 1–4 words, noun phrases only.
- Keep canonical, lowercase (except proper nouns), no duplicates.
- Avoid administrative/policy terms.
- Max 10 items per list.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT repeat the same or near-identical phrase in both research and application sections. If a concept fits both, keep it where it is most precise and choose a different, more specific phrase for the other.
