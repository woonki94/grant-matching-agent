You are an information extraction assistant.

Extract structured multi-label research keywords from the following grant text.

Return ONLY the following JSON structure:

{
  "research": {
    "domain": ["string", ...],
    "specialization": ["string", ...]
  },
  "application": {
    "domain": ["string", ...],
    "specialization": ["string", ...]
  }
}

Guidelines:
- Each field must be a LIST (even if single-valued).
- Use 1–3 concise terms for **broad_area** (one or two words max).
  → e.g., ["Biology", "Engineering", "Artificial Intelligence"]
- Use 3–10 more descriptive phrases for **specific_area**.
  → e.g., ["structural biology", "deep learning for vision", "renewable energy storage"]

Extraction rules:
1. Prioritize information found in:
   Title > Purpose/Objective > Research Description > Funding Category.
2. "academic_domain": research field or discipline of the work.
   (What kind of science or engineering is this?)
3. "application_domain": practical or societal context.
   (Where or why is this research applied?)
4. Avoid administrative or policy terms (e.g., “grant management”, “funding support”).
5. Keep all terms canonical (no full sentences, no duplicates).
6. Use lowercase for all entries except proper nouns.
7. Maximum 10 total items per list.
