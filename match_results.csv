The stated specializations are broad (biological data analysis) and reinforce general fit, but do not clearly match the grant’s focus on multi-omics integration, scalable platforms, and translational/clinical decision-support pipelines."
2a6a95f6-61e3-434f-9ec7-2f615e327b4b,Emerging Mathematics in Biology,13,Tim Alcon,0.7949724197387695,0.72,"There is meaningful overlap through computational biology/bioinformatics, which can support biological modeling and potentially AI-driven, interpretable prediction relevant to public health. However, the grant emphasizes mathematical theory and multiscale dynamical modeling, while the faculty profile is framed more as data analysis and computer science education, weakening the specialization-level fit."
150c6b5c-58b7-4f36-b4ea-177341a92b2c,Biosensing,13,Tim Alcon,0.9999406337738037,0.66,"The match is moderate: the faculty’s bioinformatics/computational biology and healthcare background aligns with the grant’s artificial intelligence and healthcare/public health components, especially for AI-assisted biosensor data analysis. However, their stated specializations do not directly cover biosensor engineering or synthetic biology (cell-free/cell-based sensing circuits), which weakens alignment with most grant technical thrusts."
3a5aa6a1-c4ed-4907-8758-5bba1be09394,Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence (SL),13,Tim Alcon,0.9999750852584839,0.63,"The domains align at a moderate level through shared interests in education and technology/AI-relevant computational approaches, but the faculty’s primary areas (computer science education, computational biology, and bioinformatics) do not directly target the grant’s core focus on cognitive/neural mechanisms of learning, transfer, and human-AI collaboration. The match strengthens only insofar as the faculty work includes adaptive learning/ed-tech or AI-driven instructional systems, which is not explicit from the listed specializations."
25d22ed0-f1fe-4c46-a5b6-0ab60a464f00,Collaboratory to Advance Mathematics Education and Learning (CAMEL) for K-12,13,Tim Alcon,0.9999604225158691,0.62,"The domains align well via education and computer science, which fit the grant’s learning sciences/AI-in-education emphasis. However, the faculty specializations are primarily computer science education and bioinformatics rather than K–12 math learning analytics, measurement, or district-scale intervention research, so the match is moderate rather than strong."
077770e0-41ee-4340-89c7-e720c8892ae9,Research in the Formation of Engineers,13,Tim Alcon,0.9999706149101257,0.56,"There is a meaningful overlap via the shared focus on education, but the grant is specifically centered on engineering education ecosystems, identity/formation, equity, workforce pathways, and sustainability. The faculty member’s specializations (computer science education, bioinformatics/computational biology) only partially reinforce this, unless their CS education work explicitly targets engineering education contexts, workforce formation, or sustainability-related curricula."

The faculty specializations are broad (computational biology/bioinformatics) and lack clear focus on multimodal biomarker discovery, longitudinal modeling, or AD/ADRD resilience, weakening the match to the grant’s specific aims."

The specializations in computational biology and bioinformatics support general fit, while the lack of demonstrated focus on multi-omics integration, variant interpretation, and oral health applications weakens the match."

The faculty’s specializations in computer science education and bioinformatics/computational biology do not directly support rehabilitation engineering or assistive technology personalization, weakening the match."

The faculty’s bioinformatics/computational biology background could transfer some ML skills, but the lack of CFD, pharmaceutics, or inhaler-specific modeling significantly weakens the match."
